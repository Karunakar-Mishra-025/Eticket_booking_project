                    Hi everyone, I am the author of this E-ticket booking project. My name is Karunakar Mishra, I am a web designer and developer. This project is based on an a ticket booking system like IRCTC. Our website is using secured payment gateway and also the trusted one i.e. Razor pay Payment Gateway. This website is based on 5 languages that are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and LARAVEL.
                    And In this website you can book tickets you can cancel it but there is one condition on canceling any ticket i.e. you should wait for at least one day for canceling any ticket. You can also print your ticket in pdf format. You can search any train you want from any two station you just have to mention the names of those two stations and the date you want to go.
